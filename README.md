# Deep [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitDecayGames/GlobalGameJam2017.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitDecayGames/GlobalGameJam2017)

Dive deep in your submarine to light the depths of the ocean. Use sonar to find obstacles beyond your sight, torpedos to remove those in your way, and discover what ancient creatures lurks underneath the waves...

## Requirements

- Java 1.8
- Maven

## Build

```bash
mvn install
```

## Run Locally

```bash
java -jar target/deep-1.0.jar dev
```

The above must be run once to compile image assets. The run again to play.

## Release

- Create a Github release. Travis will take care of the rest.
